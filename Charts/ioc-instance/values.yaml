# This value is the only mandatory override. You must declare the image for the

# a volume to mount for writing data to. This can be a PVC or a hostPath
# the PVC
dataVolume:
  # Create a PVC called {{ .Release.Name }}-data when true

  # inside/outside container paths.

# use the shared PVC for publishing opi files over http (see services/opis)
